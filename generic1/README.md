 ## OOP Lab1
 Implement sorting algorithms for list, array and linked list of own implementation for any type:
 - Quicksort  
 - Merge sort
 - Insertion sort
 
 Implement class structure of file system with required fields:
 - Size
 - Name
 - Modification time
 - Type of item

Implement find function of files in sub-tree of folder. In addition, the filesystem objects must be able to be sorted by implemented sorting algorithms.

In this implementation I also imported files from filesystem and added searching files by mask. In addition I implemented some functions in FP style. The total dificulty with additional tasks *****.
